# Kanban Board App

A simple and interactive Kanban board built with React that allows users to manage tasks across three stages: To-do, Ongoing, and Completed. The app supports drag-and-drop functionality for task management, as well as modal-based interfaces for adding, editing, and deleting tasks and containers.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Easily move tasks between containers (To-do, Ongoing, and Completed).
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks within each container.
- **Container Management**: Create and manage task containers (e.g., To-do, Ongoing, Completed).
- **Modals**: Interactive modals for adding and editing containers and tasks.
- **Responsive**: The app works well across different screen sizes.



## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and creating the responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For app functionality including state management and drag-and-drop features.
